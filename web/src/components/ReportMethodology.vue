          Prevalence calculation

        <p>
          Mutation prevalence was calculated as a ratio of the count of
          sequences containing a given set of mutations on a day at a particular
          location (or in all locations) (
          <b>x</b>
          ) divided by the total sequences on that data in that location (
          <b>n</b>
          ). 95% Confidence Intervals for these prevalences were calculated
          according to Jeffrey's Interval:

        <p>
          Dates when the lineage, variant, or mutation(s) were first and last
          found are based on the sample collection date, not the sequencing date
          or date the it was submitted to GISAID. As a result, this date may
          differ from when the sample was processed and sequenced, and when the
          data is released to the public.

          PANGO lineage classification for each individual sequence was provided
          by GISAID. Note that classifications of newer lineages by the
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pango.network/">
            Pango nomenclature system
          </a>
          are in flux and may change. While underlying sequence data remains the
          same, reports for specific lineages may change. Read more from the
          Pango team on

        <h4 id="characteristic">
          Characteristic mutations of a lineage
        </h4>

        <p>
          Characteristic mutations for a lineage are defined as nonsynonymous
          substitutions or deletions that occur in > {{ charMutThreshold }} of
          sequences within that lineage. Currently, outbreak.info currently only
          reports substitution and deletion changes, due to the computational
          challenges with identifying insertions in 5+ million sequences every
          day, but we're working towards incorporating insertions into our data
          processing pipeline. For lineages with few sequences, the
          {{ charMutThreshold }} characteristic threshold may not identify all
          the mutations specific to that lineage, and as more sequences are
          found, the characteristic mutations may change. For applications like
          reagent design which require stringent accuracy, we recommend
          downloading the consensus sequences from
          <a href="https://www.gisaid.org/" target="_blank">GISAID</a>
